# cert-manager Resources

This directory contains cert-manager custom resources for managing TLS certificates.

## Example: Self-Signed Issuer

For development/testing, you can use a self-signed certificate issuer:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

## Example: Let's Encrypt Issuer

For production with Let's Encrypt:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```
